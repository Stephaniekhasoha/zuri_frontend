        <p>
            I miss you <br>
            I miss you in all the possible ways that hurt <br>
            The kind of hurt that has gotten into my bones <br>
            I miss you in all the ways you acted in the beginning <br>
            All the ways I felt when we were together <br>
            You were boundless <br>
            You were my amazing grace <br>
            We've been fading <br>
            And only living in fleeting moments <br>
            I miss the kind of love we had <br>
            The one that felt like a Sunday morning on a Thursday evening <br>
            I miss you <br>
            And maybe just a little more because I'm scared <br>
            I never saw us coming to an end <br>
            And now I wonder <br>
            What if I never forget about you <br>
            What if I never fall in love with anyone else because they are not you <br>
            I miss us on how it felt to exceed what was real <br>
            Our love beyond time <br>
            Even if we lost a few steps <br>
            I hope you found me as I intended. <br>
